# T10 — Reduce advanced output-type complexity at creation

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Default rulebook creation to Pass/Fail and hide advanced output types behind an "Advanced settings" toggle so new users aren't overwhelmed.

## Preflight

- Baseline: clean working tree after T9 commit `43b257f`
- Build: `npm run build` exit 0, 63 routes

## Scope Confirmation

- **Target file:** `src/app/(app)/rulebooks/new/page.tsx`
- **Before:** All 3 output types (Pass/Fail, Pass/Flag/Fail, Risk Level) shown as equal radio options during creation
- **After:** Only Name + Description visible by default; output types collapsed under "Advanced settings"

## Execution Packet

### Changes Made

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| State | Added `showAdvanced` boolean (default `false`) |
| Output type section | Wrapped in collapsible toggle with chevron icon |
| Visual cue | When non-default output type selected, a pill badge shows the selection even when collapsed |
| Helper text | Added "Most rulebooks use Pass / Fail" guidance inside the expanded section |

### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Default creation path uses one simple outcome model | Pass/Fail is default; form shows only Name + Description |
| Advanced modes still available but not blocking first-run | "Advanced settings" toggle reveals all 3 output types |

### Validation Gates

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm run build` (post-change) | **exit 0**, 63 routes ✅ |
| Checklist updated | `T10` → `[x]` ✅ |
