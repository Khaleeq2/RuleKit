# T8 — Add Rulebook Overview as default entry

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Replace the redirect-to-rules pattern with a guided Overview page that shows what the rulebook does and provides clear navigation to all sub-sections.

## Preflight

- Baseline: clean working tree after T7 commit `2bf1ab0`
- Build: `npm run build` exit 0, 63 routes

## Scope Confirmation

- **Target files:** `src/app/(app)/rulebooks/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/rulebooks/[id]/layout.tsx`
- **Before:** `page.tsx` immediately redirected to `/rules` — users never saw an overview

## Execution Packet

### Overview Page (`page.tsx`)

Replaced redirect with a full Overview page containing:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Summary | Rulebook name, description (or placeholder), heading |
| Quick stats | 4-card grid: Rules (enabled/total), Schema fields, Status, Created date |
| Primary CTA | "Try it now" banner linking to Home page for running checks |
| Action cards | 4 cards (Rules, Schema, Tests, API) with icons, descriptions, live counts, arrow navigation |

### Layout Updates (`layout.tsx`)

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `isSecondaryPage` logic | `pathname !== basePath && pathname !== rules` | `!isOverview` (overview is the hub) |
| Back button | Overview/Rules → /rulebooks; secondary → /rules | Overview → /rulebooks; all sub-pages → overview |

### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| User sees "what this rulebook does" and next actions first | Overview shows description, stats, and action cards |
| Rules/schema/tests/api are clearly discoverable | All 4 shown as prominent action cards with descriptions |

### Validation Gates

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm run build` (post-change) | **exit 0**, 63 routes ✅ |
| Checklist updated | `T8` → `[x]`, `C9` → `[x]` ✅ |

## Artifacts

- Modified: `src/app/(app)/rulebooks/[id]/page.tsx` (full rewrite)
- Modified: `src/app/(app)/rulebooks/[id]/layout.tsx` (back button + nav logic)
- Updated: `MVP-CHECKLIST.md` (T8 `[x]`, C9 `[x]`)
- Report: `reports/T8.md` (this file)
