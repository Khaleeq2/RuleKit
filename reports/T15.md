# T15 — History terminology and filter simplification

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Reduce jargon on the history page so users can identify what each row represents and empty states point to clear next actions.

## Preflight

- Baseline: clean working tree after T14 commit `1e31086`
- Build: `npm run build` exit 0, 63 routes

## Scope Confirmation

- **Target file:** `src/app/(app)/history/page.tsx`

## Execution Packet

### Changes Made

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Page subtitle | "All evaluation sessions and rule runs" | "Review past checks and their results" |
| Tab 1 label | "Sessions" | "Conversations" |
| Tab 2 label | "Runs" | "Individual checks" |
| Stat label | "Total sessions" | "Conversations" |
| Stat label | "Avg messages" | "Avg. length" |
| Stat label | "Total runs" | "Total checks" |
| Search placeholder | "Search by rule, reason, or ID..." | "Search by rulebook name or result..." |
| Column header | "Time" → "When", "Rule" → "Rulebook" |
| Sessions empty state | "No sessions yet. Start an evaluation from the Home page." | "No conversations yet. Try running a check from the Home page." |
| Sessions CTA | "Start evaluating" | "Run your first check" |
| Runs empty state | "No runs yet. Runs will appear here when you execute rules." (no CTA) | "No checks yet. Results will appear here after you run a rulebook." + CTA button |
| Runs empty icon | AlertTriangle | Clock (less alarming) |

### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Users can identify what each row represents without docs | "Conversations" and "Individual checks" are self-explanatory; "Rulebook" column header is clear |
| Empty states point clearly to next action | Both tabs have "Run your first check" CTA linking to /home |

### Validation Gates

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm run build` (post-change) | **exit 0**, 63 routes ✅ |
| Checklist updated | `T15` → `[x]` ✅ |
