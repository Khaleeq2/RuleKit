# T12 — Simplify tests editor copy and expected input guidance

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Reduce jargon in the tests editor, add plain-language guidance, and make expected vs actual results visually obvious.

## Preflight

- Baseline: clean working tree after T11 commit `ba653f2`
- Build: `npm run build` exit 0, 63 routes

## Scope Confirmation

- **Target file:** `src/app/(app)/rulebooks/[id]/tests/page.tsx`

## Execution Packet

### Changes Made

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Empty state | "No test cases yet. Add tests to verify your rulebook logic." | Heading + explanation + concrete example: "A 25-year-old with $80k income should pass the loan check." |
| Empty state CTA | "Add first test" | "Create your first test" |
| Editor title | "Add test" | "Create a test" |
| Editor description | "Define the input and expected output for this test case" | "Provide sample input and the result you expect — RuleKit will check if your rules agree." |
| Input JSON label | "Input JSON" | "Test input" with helper: "The data your rules will evaluate. Use JSON format." |
| Input placeholder | `{}` | Auto-generated from schema fields with example values |
| Schema fields hint | "Expected fields: field1, field2" | "Your schema fields:" with `<code>` pills |
| Expected verdict label | "Expected verdict" | "What result do you expect?" |
| Expected reason label | "Expected reason (optional)" | "Why? (optional)" with helper text |
| Expected reason placeholder | "Expected reason message" | "e.g., Credit score is above 650" |
| Result comparison | Both in muted gray | "Got" text colored green (pass) or red (fail) with → arrow |

### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| User can create and run one test with built-in guidance | Plain-language labels, auto-populated placeholder from schema, concrete example in empty state |
| Expected vs actual output is visually obvious | "Got" value color-coded green/red, arrow separator (→) between expected and actual |

### Validation Gates

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm run build` (post-change) | **exit 0**, 63 routes ✅ |
| Checklist updated | `T12` → `[x]` ✅ |
