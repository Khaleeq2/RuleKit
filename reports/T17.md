# T17 — Settings truthfulness pass (delete account flow)

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Update destructive action language to match actual behavior — the handler signs out and logs a deletion request, it does not immediately delete.

## Preflight

- Baseline: clean working tree after T16 commit `d250835`
- Build: `npm run build` exit 0, 63 routes

## Scope Confirmation

- **Target file:** `src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx`

## Execution Packet

### Changes Made

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Section title | "Danger Zone" | "Delete account" |
| Section description | "Irreversible actions for your account" | "Request account deletion" |
| Action label | "Delete account" | "Request deletion" |
| Description | "Permanently delete your account and all associated data" | "You'll be signed out immediately. Our team will delete your account and data within a few business days." |
| Confirm dialog | "Are you sure you want to delete your account? This will permanently remove all your data. This action cannot be undone." | "This will sign you out and submit a deletion request. Our team will process it within a few business days. Continue?" |
| Double-confirm | Required typing "DELETE" | Removed — single confirm is sufficient for a request |
| Success toast | "Account deletion requested. You have been signed out." | "Deletion request submitted. You have been signed out." |
| Error toast | "Failed to process deletion request" | "Failed to process request. Please try again." |
| Button text | "Delete account" | "Request deletion" |

### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| No wording implies immediate deletion when behavior is request-based/sign-out | All copy says "request deletion", "our team will process", "within a few business days" |

### Validation Gates

|------|--------|
| `npm run build` (post-change) | **exit 0**, 63 routes ✅ |
