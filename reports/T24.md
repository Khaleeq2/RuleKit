# T24 — Harden smoke tests and report integrity

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Make auth-guard smoke tests strict and correct test-count evidence.

## Scope

- `/Users/khaleeq/Documents/projects/RuleKit/rulekit-v0.2/tests/smoke.spec.ts`
- `/Users/khaleeq/Documents/projects/RuleKit/rulekit-v0.2/reports/T19.md`

## Changes Made

- Strengthened unauthenticated redirect assertions:
  - Require final URL path to be `/auth/sign-in`.
  - Assert `redirect` query param matches original route (`/home`, `/rulebooks`).
- Corrected T19 report count from `10` to `13` tests.

## Validation

- `npm run test:smoke` -> `13 passed`
- `npm run build` -> exit `0`

## Acceptance

- [x] Redirect checks fail if auth guard behavior regresses.
- [x] Test report metadata matches real suite size.
