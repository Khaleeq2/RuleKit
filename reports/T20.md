# T20 — Remove duplicate planning docs or link them to this master

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Avoid checklist fragmentation by making MVP-CHECKLIST.md the single active master and archiving competing docs.

## Preflight

- Baseline: clean working tree after T19 commit `f7ee993`
- Build: `npm run build` exit 0, 63 routes

## Scope Confirmation

- **Target files:** `TODO.md`, `ONBOARDING-PLAN.md`, `DESIGN-AUDIT.md`, `MVP.md`
- **Kept as-is:** `PRODUCTION-DEPLOY.md` (operational doc), `The_Conversion_Manifesto-Principles.md` (design philosophy), `README.md`

## Execution Packet

### Changes Made

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `TODO.md` | Added archive banner: "⚠️ ARCHIVED — This document is historical. The active task tracker is MVP-CHECKLIST.md." |
| `ONBOARDING-PLAN.md` | Added archive banner: "⚠️ ARCHIVED — This strategy has been implemented." |
| `DESIGN-AUDIT.md` | Added archive banner: "⚠️ ARCHIVED — This audit informed the task list in MVP-CHECKLIST.md." |
| `MVP.md` | Added archive banner: "⚠️ ARCHIVED — This spec has been superseded by MVP-CHECKLIST.md." |

### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| This file is the active master | All 4 competing docs now point to MVP-CHECKLIST.md |
| Other docs are archived or explicitly linked as reference-only | Each has a visible ⚠️ ARCHIVED banner at the top |

### Validation Gates

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm run build` (post-change) | **exit 0**, 63 routes ✅ |
| Checklist updated | `T20` → `[x]` ✅ |

## Artifacts

- Modified: `TODO.md`, `ONBOARDING-PLAN.md`, `DESIGN-AUDIT.md`, `MVP.md`
- Updated: `MVP-CHECKLIST.md` (T20 `[x]`)
- Report: `reports/T20.md` (this file)
