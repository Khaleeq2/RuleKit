# T23 — Align public developer docs with current auth model

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Remove public Bearer/API-key guidance that conflicts with the current session-auth backend.

## Scope

- `/Users/khaleeq/Documents/projects/RuleKit/rulekit-v0.2/src/app/(marketing)/developers/quickstart/page.tsx`
- `/Users/khaleeq/Documents/projects/RuleKit/rulekit-v0.2/src/app/(marketing)/resources/docs/page.tsx`

## Changes Made

- Rewrote developer quickstart to current flow:
  - `POST /api/evaluate`
  - `credentials: "include"`
  - exact payload contract and response shape
- Removed bearer token + `/v1/evaluate` + API key management instructions.
- Updated docs hub sections:
  - `API Keys & Auth` -> `Authentication (current)` with session-cookie description
  - `Webhooks & Integrations` -> `Integrations roadmap` with planned-status language
- Ensured planned capabilities are labeled as planned.

## Validation

- `npm run build` -> exit `0`
- `npm run test:smoke` -> `13 passed`

## Acceptance

- [x] No public quickstart content instructs current users to use Bearer/API key for `/api/evaluate`.
- [x] Planned integrations are presented as roadmap items.
