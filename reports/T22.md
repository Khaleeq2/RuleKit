# T22 — Remove false account deletion implications

## Status: ✅ DONE

## Objective

Ensure Settings copy reflects actual behavior: sign-out only, not deletion processing.

## Scope

- `/Users/khaleeq/Documents/projects/RuleKit/rulekit-v0.2/src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx`

## Changes Made

- Replaced deletion-request language with truthful sign-out language.
- Renamed UI section to "Account access" and clarified outcome.
- Updated confirmation text to sign-out semantics only.
- Updated success/error toasts to sign-out semantics.
- Added explicit support link (`/contact`) for actual deletion requests.

## Validation

- `npm run build` -> exit `0`
- `npm run test:smoke` -> `13 passed`

## Acceptance

- [x] No UI text claims deletion submission when only sign-out occurs.
- [x] Clear next step exists for users who want deletion.
